## NighTimer

Once the babies are finally asleep, once I am finally asleep, I tend to want to stay that way.
Unfortunately, if something wakes me up and I happen to see what time it is, there is a good
chance that the brain will start thinking "Well, I only have 1 hour to sleep left, whats the point."

Also, with a little one in the room, I sometimes want to keep track of things, such as "when did he last
wake up?" But again, I'd rather not look at the clock to figure that out.

Enter NighTimer. I'm writing this to be able to answer two things:

  * Is it "about" time to wake up? A simple yes/no, with a configurable tolerance.
  * Capture data points for later study

## Random Stuff
  * Yes, I know phones usually have a clock on the lock screen, as well as at the top.
I generally can unlock my phone without observing the time.
  * There is probably an app that does this. I like writing little apps myself from time to time.
